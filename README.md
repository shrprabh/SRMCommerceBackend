## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SRM Commerce Backend follows Clean Architecture principles with Domain-Driven Design:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Api/             # API endpoints and controllers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Application/     # Application services, DTOs, and validators
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Domain/          # Domain entities, value objects, and business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Infrastructure/  # External services, repositories, and data access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Shared/          # Cross-cutting concerns and utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.Workers/         # Background processing services

tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.UnitTests/       # Unit tests for all components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.IntegrationTests/# Integration tests for API and services
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SRM.Commerce.PerformanceTests/# Performance and load testing
```

The system implements:
- **CQRS Pattern** - Separating read and write operations for optimal performance
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstracting data access logic
- **Mediator Pattern** - Decoupling request processing from handling
- **Unit of Work** - Managing transaction consistency
- **Specification Pattern** - Encapsulating query logic

## üìù API Documentation

The API follows RESTful principles with consistent endpoint design:

```
/api/v1/products                # Product management
/api/v1/customers               # Customer operations
/api/v1/orders                  # Order processing
/api/v1/inventory               # Inventory management
/api/v1/payments                # Payment processing
/api/v1/analytics               # Reporting and analytics
```

Complete API documentation is available via Swagger UI when running the application:
```
https://localhost:5001/swagger
```
